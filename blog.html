      <h3><b>Is My Website "CRAP"?</b></h3>
      <h5>A Quick Guide, <span class="w3-opacity">November 11, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>One of the most fundamental elements of any successful website is the ability to display information in a way that is appealing to the end user. Nitin Deshdeep's VWO blog <a href = "https://vwo.com/blog/crap-design-principles/">post</a> says, "You know a good (or a bad) design when you see one." In the article, Deshdeep talks about the importance of understanding the CRAP design principles in order to enhance the value of your website's content.</p>
        <p id = "article1" style="display: none">
            If you're wondering what CRAP stands for, its Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity.  These design principles are what helps to shape the content that we see on the internet and various print media.  With this information, you may ask, "Is My Website CRAP?"  Are there fundamental issues in the way that I am approaching contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity on my website?  Is it affecting the way that users perceive my brand? <br><br>

            In order to answer these questions, I want to show some examples of how to use the CRAP design principles in your favor, while also providing some examples of what not to do.<br><br>

            When you think of contrast, your mind may immediately swing to black and white images or dark text on a light background.  While these are some examples of the way that contrast can be used in web design, it is important to remember that contrast can be created using different element types, shape, size, and more.  Below is an example of a website with poor contrast, potentially causing hte user to miss important information in the black area.<br><br>

Compare the poor contrast above with the exemplary contrast on the Evernote Page below.  Notice how all of the text is easily readable, with high contrast on menu, button, and graphic elements.<br><br>



The article that I discussed in the beginning has a more in-depth look at the different elements that can affect contrast, but I want to move on to talking about repetition.  Repition is important to consider when designing your website because it helps to make the user comfortable and feel familiar when interacting with your page.  The example below, which is a screenshot of Suzanne Collins (Author of the Hunger Games Series) website, shows why repition is incredibly important in ensuring that a website looks professional.<br><br>



There is no discernible pattern or repition of the way that the content is displayed on the website.  Content is placed with little regard to the location of other page elements.  Compare Suzanne Collins' website with one of BestBuy below and notice how the use of similar elements in repetition makes the page look neat, even with many different options to choose from.<br><br>




The next area that you should address when it comes to evaluating the design of your website is the use of alignment.  Like repetition, alignment creates order that is comforting to the end user.  Below is an example that highlights the difference between good and bad alignment in web design.  This example shows the difference that using left-aligned text as a splash screen / landing page has on the overall appearance of the page.  The left-aligned text provides a level of uniformity and familiarity that the center-aligned content does not.<br><br>

The final element that can make or break your website design is the element of proximity.  Proximity helps the user to differentiate between content areas and group different elements together.  Appropriate use of whitespace is paramount when considering the implications of proximity in website design.  The examples below highlight the extremes when it comes to the improper use of whitespace and proximity.<br><br>


The above example utilizes too much whitespace between paragraphs, and leads the user to perceive the paragraphs as completely separate entities.  Below, there is too little whitespace, which leaves the user struggling to read and identify different sections of the page.<br><br>


While this was only an introductory look at the elements that make up the CRAP website principles, I hope that you will be able to take away an idea that will help to refine the look and fell of your website.  In an increasingly competitive interent-driven world, it is extremely important to make sure that your website isn't being held back by failing to focus on the elements that look like "CRAP".<br><br>

      <h3><b>Human-Computer Interaction in the Real World</b></h3>
      <h5>A Brief Look, <span class="w3-opacity">January 2, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I recently came across an article that talked about <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google Duplex</a>, an exciting new project that Google is working on to accomplish real-life tasks over the phone. This article introduces readers to the revolutionary advances in human-computer interaction that Google is making with its Duplex AI. Currently isolated to very specific functions like setting up hair appointments and restaurant reservations, the Duplex AI system is able to carry on remarkably lifelike conversations with humans. By exploring the narrow scope of its abilities to an extreme extent, Duplex can reproduce conversations that sound human like in their nature and responsiveness.</p>
        <p id = "article2" style="display: none">
            One of the reasons that Google Duplex is so exciting for those that are interested in the field of HCI is because of its ability to conduct one of its most challenging problems: utilizing context clues to understand what people mean, instead of strictly what they say.  Its cognitive process starts by processing the human speech through an automatic speech recognition system. Those words are then combined with contextual information related to the specific call (date, time, type of appointment, etc.) that is related to historical trends in similar conversations.  This process helps Google Duplex to be able to understand the human on the other end of the phone call.<br><br>
            
            While the awareness and understanding shown by Google Duplex is amazing on its own accord, the AI system has attracted attention for its remarkable human-like speech  when asking and responding to questions. It uses a combination of text to speech techniques in order to pronounce words smoothly, even adding typical pauses like "umm"s and "ah"s to sound more realistic.  The response process works alongside the listening and comprehension processes by prioritizing questions and statements that typically garner a quicker response in order to maintain fluidity in the conversation.<br><br>
            
            Although the functionality of Google Duplex is purposely limited during its development, the possibilities that it represents in HCI are seemingly endless.  Duplex has the possibility to represent the future of our ability to communicate with artificially intelligent systems in a variety of different industries and settings, and revolutionize the HCI industry in the process.

      <h3><b>Cloud Computing and IoT</b></h3>
      <h5>A Quick Guide, <span class="w3-opacity">August 2, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
        <p>As I was conducting research for a class assignment on the Internet of Things, I came across an <a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/internet-of-things-cloud-computing-2016-10">article from Business Insider</a> that described the differences between two exciting new industries: cloud computing and the internet of things.
        </p>
        <p id = "article3" style="display: none">
           Cloud computing and the internet of things are two movements in the IT and software engineering fields that are continuing to gain traction.  Cloud computing focuses on providing a way for businesses to use the internet to connect to off-premise storage and compute infrastructure.  The Interent of Things exists as a network of physical devices that use embedded sensors and other hardware to collect and transfer data in order to gain insight and inform decision-making.  While cloud computing and the Internet of Things can operate independently of each other in many different scenarios, the two technologies really begin to hit their stride when their functions are combined.<br><br>
            
            Together, cloud computing and IoT have the potential to revolutionize the way that people use technology to make informed, data-driven decisions.  Many companies now offer cloud service packages so that developers can leverage the computing power for IoT projects.  <a href = "https://www.iotforall.com/cloud-fog-computing-iot/">Microsoft</a> has its Azure suite, Amazon has an IoT-specific application suite within its widely-popular Amazon Web Services collection, and IBM offers access to the Watson platform via its Bluemix cloud.  The promise of on-demand scalability and a wealth of other services continues to draw companies and developers to the idea of combining the power of cloud computing and IoT.<br><br>
            
            On a more fundamental level, cloud computing technology allows IoT projects to handle the huge amount of data per second that they can generate, decreases the cost of deploying expensive hardare, and makes it easier to scale up the infrastructure without blowing through a development budget.  There are typically <a href = "https://www.einfochips.com/blog/importance-of-cloud-computing-for-large-scale-iot-solutions/">three types of cloud computing models</a> that are being used in IoT projects that help to accomplish these goals: Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service.  Infrastructure as a service provides access to networking components for use in IoT projects.  Platform as a service allows companies to create software and applications from the tools and libraries provided by the cloud service providers.  Software as a service provides a complete software or application that is run and maintained only by the cloud service provider. <br><br>
            
            Going forward, IoT project managers and industry leaders will continue to make important decisions about the future of connectivity between cloud computing and the Internet of Things.
